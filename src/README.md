# Python Source Code

This folder contains all Python-based software developed for the capstone
project, including standalone sensor demos and the integrated fusion system.

The code is organized to reflect the development process used during the
project: individual subsystems were validated independently before being
combined into a unified sensor fusion application.

---

## Folder Structure

- `Standalone_Demos/`  
  Contains independent demos used to validate individual sensors and
  algorithms, such as radar operation, point cloud processing, and vision-based
  detection.

- `Camera_&_Fusion_Demos/`  
  Contains the integrated system that runs the camera and radar simultaneously
  and performs sensor fusion.

Each subfolder may contain its own README with instructions specific to that
component.
