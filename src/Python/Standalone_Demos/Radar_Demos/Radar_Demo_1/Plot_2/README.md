# Radar Point Cloud Demo

This folder contains code used to parse, visualize, and analyze point cloud
data generated by the mmWave radar sensor.

The point cloud demo was developed to better understand radar output structure
and validate spatial information prior to higher-level processing and sensor
fusion.

---

## Purpose

This demo focuses on:
- interpreting radar point cloud data
- visualizing detected points in space
- validating range and spatial consistency
- gaining insight into radar behavior in indoor environments

The point cloud output was also explored as a potential input for future
machine learning work.

---

## Contents

This folder may include:
- Python scripts for parsing radar point cloud data
- Visualization scripts for plotting point cloud output
- Logged data files (e.g., CSV or binary captures)

Script names may vary depending on the development stage.

---

## Hardware Requirements

- mmWave radar sensor connected via USB
- Radar must be configured and streaming data correctly

---

## Running the Demo

From this directory:
```bash
python <script_name>.py
